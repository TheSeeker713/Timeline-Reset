# QUICK FIX - Audio Not Playing

## Problem
Cookie is set from previous testing. The app thinks you already played the audio!

## Solution

**In your browser console (F12), run these two commands:**

```javascript
window.__AUDIO_API__.deleteCookie()
location.reload()
```

## What This Does
1. Deletes the `timeline_reset_audio_played` cookie
2. Reloads the page fresh
3. You're now a "first-time visitor" again

## Test Flow (After Reset)

1. ✅ Page loads - NO message, NO portal, play button active
2. ✅ Click play button
3. ✅ Audio starts playing (`reset.mp3`)
4. ✅ Secret message appears: "Listen closely... truth hides between the frequencies"
5. ✅ Wait for audio to finish
6. ✅ Portal appears automatically after audio ends
7. ✅ Portal shows: "The Rift Awaits Your Code"
8. ✅ Input accepts coded phrase (not date/time)

## Expected Console Output (Clean Start)

```
🚀 Timeline Reset initializing...
Target: 2025-11-11T18:11:00.000Z
✅ Timeline Reset initialized
🔊 Audio player initialized with cookie persistence

[Click play button]

🎯 Play button clicked!
isPlaying: false hasPlayed: false
✅ Proceeding to play audio
🎵 playAudio() called
▶️ Calling audioElement.play()...
✅ Audio play() promise resolved
📜 Secret message revealed
▶️ Audio playing

[Audio finishes]

⏹️ Audio ended

```

## Portal Changes
- ❌ Old: "Input Temporal Coordinates Below" + "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
- ✅ New: "The Rift Awaits Your Code" + "Enter the phrase..."
- Input accepts any text (coded phrase)
- Still time-locked until 11/11/2025 11:11 AM MST
